Overview
The Rest Assured TestNG Java Maven Automation Framework for Spotify Playlist APIs allows you to create and execute automated tests for Spotify playlist-related API endpoints. It provides a set of reusable test cases and utility methods to simplify the testing process. The framework is designed to be easily customizable and extendable, allowing you to add new tests and modify existing ones as per your requirements.

Features
Automation of various Spotify playlist API endpoints.
Reusable test cases for common playlist functionalities such as creation, deletion, modification, etc.
Support for authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) required for accessing Spotify APIs.
Customizable and extensible framework architecture.
TestNG-based test execution for parallel and sequential test runs.
Detailed reporting of test results.
Prerequisites
Before setting up and using the automation framework, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Apache Maven
Rest Assured
TestNG
Git (optional)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the source code as a ZIP file.

Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) and Apache Maven installed on your system.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

Build the project using Maven by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
This will download the project dependencies and build the framework.

Getting Started
To start using the automation framework for testing Spotify playlist APIs, follow these steps:

Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
Explore the existing test cases under the src/test/java directory. You can modify them or create new ones as needed.
Update the configuration file (src/test/resources/config.properties) with your Spotify API credentials and other required settings.
Implement the necessary utility classes and methods to handle authentication, request/response parsing, and any custom functionality required for your tests.
Execute the tests using TestNG test runners or the provided Maven commands.
Test Execution
You can execute the tests using one of the following methods:

Execute tests using TestNG XML configuration:

Create a TestNG XML file specifying the test classes or test suites to execute.
Run the XML file using TestNG in your IDE or using the command line.
Execute tests using Maven commands:

Run all tests:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean test
Run tests with specific groups:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean test -Dgroups=groupName
Run a specific test class:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean test -Dtest=TestClass
For more advanced options, refer to the TestNG and Maven documentation.

Reporting
The framework generates detailed test reports that provide insights into the test execution results. The reports can be found in the target/surefire-reports directory after test execution. You can view them in
